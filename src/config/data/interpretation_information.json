She is a tomboy - does not draw hearts and is not enamored in pink. Has great sense of rhythm and likes to sing. Dancing, particularly ballet, does not suit her - she moves freely with color and invents something new each time. She is her own choreographer. Could enjoy capoeira, sculpture or pottery classes.
